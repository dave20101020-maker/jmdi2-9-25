This repository is used for internal testing and development.

## Environment

Create a `.env` file (or update your existing one) with the Firebase credentials used by the Vite frontend:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=""
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=""
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=""
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=""
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=""

```

Ask your platform admin for the correct values before running the app locally.
