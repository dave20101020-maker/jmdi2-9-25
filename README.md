# Development Workspace

This repository is used for internal testing and development.

## Environment

Create a `.env` file (or update your existing one) that points the Vite frontend at the backend API:

```
VITE_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3001"
```

Ask your platform admin for the correct values before running the app locally.
