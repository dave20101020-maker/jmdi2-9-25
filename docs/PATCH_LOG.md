## Workflow

Every time a patch is applied:

1. Apply via Copilot
2. Commit with a patch/<team>/<area> message
3. Add an entry here with ✔
4. Ask Lead: “Lead, confirm patches applied and generate next tasks.”

🔧 Step 3 — Update it EVERY TIME you apply a patch

That gives you an always-accurate record.
